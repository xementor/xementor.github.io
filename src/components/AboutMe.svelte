			<p class="pt-6">
				"Hello there! I'm Md. Zonaid, and I'm passionate about crafting internet
				products through coding. My journey into the world of coding began in
				2013 when I gained access to play video games on my Java Nokia mobile
				phone. Curiosity led me to start searching on Google for ways to build
				apps and games. At that time, I didn't have access to a laptop, but that
				didn't stop me. I eventually learned Java and began my journey into
				Android app development."

				"Fast-forward to today, and I'm immersed in the world of computer
				science. I'm currently pursuing a degree in computer science while
				actively engaging in various web projects. My passion lies in continuous
				learning and building innovative solutions using technologies like React
				and React Native. Whether it's web development or mobile applications,
				I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and creating impactful digital
				experiences."
