			<p class="pt-6">
				Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on the
				internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I
				decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together
				a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
			</p>
			<p class="pt-6">
				Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an
				advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led
				design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
				inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety
				of clients.
			</p>

			<p>
				I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to
				build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.

				Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
				<li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
				<li>TypeScript</li>
				<li>React</li>
				<li>Node.js</li>
