## Project Title: Multi-Media NFT Marketplace with Stellar Integration

### Overview

The Multi-Media NFT Marketplace project aimed to create an expansive platform allowing administrators to upload various media types (videos, audios, images, and gifs) to generate unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Stellar blockchain. Users, upon login using Stellar, Google, or Facebook accounts, could buy these NFTs representing multimedia content and access/view the purchased media. Additionally, users could resell original items purchased from admins and even revoke their NFTs from the marketplace.

### Project Duration

The project commenced on Nov 9, 2023 and was successfully completed within 2 month.

### Role

As a lead developer, my responsibilities encompassed designing and developing the platform architecture. I utilized React for frontend development, integrated Stellar's blockchain functionalities for NFT creation, managed user authentication via Stellar, Google, and Facebook OAuth, and implemented the Square payment system for website NFT recharging.

### Technologies/Tools Used

- MetaFramework: Next.js
- Database: Firebase
- Blockchain: StellarSDK
- Authentication: Stellar, Google OAuth, Facebook OAuth
- Payment System: Square
- Media Handling: Video, Audio, Image, Gif

### Project Description

The project's core functionality involved enabling admins to upload various media types, creating NFTs for each uploaded item using Stellar's blockchain. The platform showcased these NFTs for user purchase. Users, authenticated via Stellar, Google, or Facebook, had the capability to buy these multimedia NFTs and view/play the purchased content.

An exceptional feature allowed users to resell original items bought from admins. Users could add their purchased items to the marketplace for resale, leveraging the NFT they owned. Additionally, users had the option to revoke their NFTs from the marketplace, removing the item from potential resale.

A significant integration involved handling transactions in Stellar to change trust, enabling seamless payments and recharges on the platform via the Square payment system.
