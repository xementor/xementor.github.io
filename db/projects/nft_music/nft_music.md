## Project Title: Audio NFT Marketplace Platform

### Overview

The Audio NFT Marketplace project aimed to create a platform where administrators could upload audio files, convert them into unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Stellar blockchain, and display them on a dedicated webpage. Users, upon logging in with their Stellar accounts, had the ability to purchase these NFTs representing audio files and subsequently access and play the purchased audio content.

### Project Duration

The project commenced in Sep 25, 2023 and was completed within 2 month.

### Role

As a key contributor, my role encompassed designing and developing the platform architecture using Next.js for frontend development, Firebase for user authentication and data storage, and AWS Amplify for hosting. I also integrated blockchain functionalities utilizing the StellarSDK in TypeScript for NFT creation. The frontend styling was accomplished using Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI.

### Technologies/Tools Used

- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI
- Backend: Firebase, AWS Amplify
- Blockchain: StellarSDK
- Programming Language: TypeScript
- Database: Firebase Firestore

### Project Description

The project involved creating a seamless audio NFT marketplace where administrators could effortlessly upload audio files. Upon upload, the system utilized the StellarSDK in TypeScript to generate unique NFTs linked to specific audio files on the Stellar blockchain. These NFTs were elegantly showcased on a user-friendly webpage built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI.

Authenticated users logged in via their Stellar accounts through Firebase authentication and had the privilege to explore and purchase available audio NFTs. Upon purchasing an NFT, users gained access to the audio content, which they could play through the platform's integrated audio player.

### Challenges Faced

- **Blockchain Integration:** Integrating StellarSDK and TypeScript for NFT creation posed initial technical hurdles.
- **User Authentication:** Ensuring secure user authentication through Firebase with Stellar wallet integration demanded meticulous development efforts.

### Achievements

- Successful integration of Next.js, Firebase, and StellarSDK for creating a functional audio NFT marketplace.
- Seamless user experience in browsing, purchasing, and accessing audio content.

### Impact

- Provided a novel platform for users to engage with audio content through blockchain-based ownership.
- Offered artists and creators an opportunity to tokenize and sell their audio creations as NFTs.

### Key Learnings

- In-depth understanding of blockchain integration within a web platform using TypeScript and StellarSDK.
- Enhanced proficiency in frontend development with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI.

### Future Scope

- Expansion to support various file formats and additional blockchain networks.
- Implementation of social features enabling user-creator interaction.
