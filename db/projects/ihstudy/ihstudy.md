## Introduction

In today's digital age, learning has evolved, and the traditional classroom setup has expanded beyond brick-and-mortar walls. Students are looking for engaging, interactive, and accessible ways to enhance their education. Enter **ihStudy** - a cutting-edge study platform that redefines the learning experience. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at **ihStudy**, its key technologies, and the challenges faced during development.

## Technologies Utilized

1. **React Native:** IhStudy harnesses the power of React Native, a cross-platform development technology. This enables students to access their courses and materials seamlessly on both web and mobile devices, making learning flexible and convenient.

2. **Next.js:** For the web version of ihStudy, we adopted Next.js, a React framework known for its server-side rendering capabilities. This choice enhances the web application's performance and speed, providing users with a smooth learning experience.

3. **Solito Library:** Navigation is a crucial aspect of any application, and Solito Library comes to the rescue. This library simplifies navigation, making it effortless to transition between different sections of the platform, whether you're using it on the web or a mobile device.

4. **Redux:** To efficiently manage and persist data, we integrated Redux. With Redux, ihStudy can store user data and preferences securely, ensuring a personalized and consistent experience across devices.

## Overcoming Development Challenges

### Monorepo Management

Building a cross-platform application with React Native and Next.js required us to set up a monorepo. However, this journey wasn't without its challenges. We encountered several errors and hiccups along the way. Through perseverance and diligent problem-solving, we successfully navigated the complexities of managing a monorepo.

### Cross-Platform Design

One of the core principles of ihStudy is providing a consistent and appealing user interface across all platforms. To achieve this, we leveraged the power of NativeBase and Tailwind CSS for our design elements. However, cross-platform design came with its own set of hurdles. Through extensive research and iterative design adjustments, we ensured that the platform's aesthetics were flawless, no matter where it was accessed from.
